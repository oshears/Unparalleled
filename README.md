Unparalleled 
By Osaze Shears 

Project Goal: The goal of the game is to provide players with a retro-style, top-down shooter, arcade 
game. The player must stay alive for as long as he or she can without being touched by any enemies. The 
game features the commonly used “WASD” control system and colorful particle effects based on various 
player actions (i.e. movement and enemy destruction). Currently there are three enemy types: Pointers, 
Quads, and Sinkers. Each enemy type is worth a designated amount of points, and the player can see the 
amount of points he or she has accumulated in the top left corner, along with the current wave number. 
As the wave number increases, the amount of enemies being spawned also increases, therefore making 
the game harder the longer the player stays alive. If the player is touched by an enemy, then he or she 
will die and the game ends. 

Features: 
 -Custom Designed Title Screen 
 -Simple 8-Button Control System for Moving and Shooting 
 -Particle Effects for Player Movement and Enemy Destruction 
 -Retro Sound Effects and Music 
 -In-Game GUI Showing the Player’s Score and Wave Number 
 -Various Enemy Types to Add Difficulty and Replay Value 
 -A Wave-Based Spawning System to Increase the Difficulty of the Game 

Controls: 
Use the “W”, “A”, “S”, or “D” keys to move the ship in any direction. Use the arrow keys to fire lasers in 
any of the four directions. Alternatively, hold two adjacent arrow keys in order to fire diagonally.
